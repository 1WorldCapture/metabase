# Questions overview

Questions are queries plus their visualization. You can 

- Ask questions using Metabase's graphical query builder, or create a native/SQL query.
- Ask questions based on models, raw tables, or other saved questions.
- Save questions to collections and add them to dashboards.
- And a lot more
