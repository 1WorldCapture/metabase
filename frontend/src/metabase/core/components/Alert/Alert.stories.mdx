# Alert

<Alert icon="info">Heads up, you're about to use an Alert component</Alert>

Use alerts when you need to communicate important contextual information to a user
that is about to perform a task.

## Variations

### Info

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Info">
    <Alert icon="key">
      It helps to have your API key avaliable for this next part
    </Alert>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Use the info variant when there is information that could be helpful but isn’t critical
or blocking to the user trying to perform the task.

### Error

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Error">
    <Alert icon="info" variant="error">
      Hey anything?
    </Alert>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Use an error alert when the user may be negatively affected or blocked by something, especially if they cannot change that fact from where they are.

## Design reference

### Visual style

Alerts are meant to be noticed regardless of variant and should include a relevant icon as part of the content to help with quick parsing.

### Behavior

Alerts are not dismiss able. If you’re looking for a notification someone can dismiss, try a Toast.

### Writing considerations

As always, be sure to use Metabase product voice when writing copy for an alert.
